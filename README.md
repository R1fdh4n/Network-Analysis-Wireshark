# Network-Analysis-Wireshark

In the first part of this project I will be analysing a .pcap file from a CTF(Capture The Flag) that I participated and the CTF is conducted by RedTeam Hacker Academy, Kochi. In the second part I will capture the network traffic between the Kali linux (attacker machine) and the metasploitable 2 machine (target machine) that has been configured from the previous project.


## Objective

This lab focuses on building skills in network analysis using Wireshark by capturing and analyzing traffic in a controlled environment. It aims to provide practical experience in understanding protocols, detecting security threats, and investigating network-based attacks, enhancing expertise in traffic inspection and network security monitoring.

### Skills Learned

- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.
- **Protocol Understanding:** Study protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, ARP, and more.
- **Traffic Filtering:** Apply Wireshark filters to isolate and focus on specific traffic types.
- **Attack Detection:** Identify network attacks such as ARP spoofing, brute-force attempts, and DoS.
- **Packet Inspection:** Examine packet details for anomalies or malicious behavior.
- **Report Generation:** Document findings with detailed analysis and visualizations.
- **Network Security Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic for potential threats and suspicious activity.

### Tools Used

- **Wireshark:** For capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- **Kali Linux:** For generating network traffic and simulating attacks.
- **Metasploitable 2:** A vulnerable virtual machine used as a target for traffic analysis.
- **tcpdump:** A command-line tool for capturing network packets before analyzing them in Wireshark.

## Steps
### Step 1: Download and open the .pcap file into wireshark
-What is Wireshark? 
  Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education. It is in-built applcation in Kali Linux.
  For other Operating Systems use, https://www.wireshark.org/download.html
- Identity_Trail.pcap is the .pcap (Packet capture) that is to be analysed for Identifying the missing person name. It is uploaded in the files above section
