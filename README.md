# Network-Analysis-Wireshark

## Objective

This lab focuses on building skills in network analysis using Wireshark by capturing and analyzing traffic in a controlled environment. It aims to provide practical experience in understanding protocols, detecting security threats, and investigating network-based attacks, enhancing expertise in traffic inspection and network security monitoring.

### Skills Learned

- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.
- **Protocol Understanding:** Study protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, ARP, and more.
- **Traffic Filtering:** Apply Wireshark filters to isolate and focus on specific traffic types.
- **Attack Detection:** Identify network attacks such as ARP spoofing, brute-force attempts, and DoS.
- **Packet Inspection:** Examine packet details for anomalies or malicious behavior.
- **Report Generation:** Document findings with detailed analysis and visualizations.
- **Network Security Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic for potential threats and suspicious activity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
